Fibonacci (recursive): work doubles at each step → O(2ⁿ); time skyrockets.

Fibonacci (iterative): single pass → O(n); time scales linearly and stays tiny.

Linked list (recursive insert): one call per node → O(n) stack and call overhead.

Linked list (iterative insert): one frame → O(1) stack, typically faster.
